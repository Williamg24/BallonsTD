Group Members: Maya Mori and William Guo

# Brief Project description:
A recreation of bloons tower defense with enemies and automatic towers. There will be a map and a path where the enemies will traverse through during the game. The objective will be to prevent any enemy from passing the end of the path with the towers / units. On the map, it'll be up to the players to place the towers as they see fit as long as itâ€™s not on the path. There will be currency to buy the units and hp points that decrease depending on the type of enemy that passes through to the end of the path. The basic features for each tower/unit will be damage points and range while the enemies will have health points and speed. Other add-ons include but are not limited to upgrades for the towers in terms of damage and range, different types of units that have special abilities, power ups, a pause button etc.
