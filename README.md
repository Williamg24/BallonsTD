Group Members: Maya Mori and William Guo

# Brief Project description:
A recreation of bloons tower defense with enemies and automatic towers. There will be different maps and a path where the enemies will traverse through during the game. The objective will be to prevent any enemy from passing the end of the path with the towers. On the map, it'll be up to the players to place the towers as they see fit as long as itâ€™s not on the path. There will be currency to buy the units and hp points that decrease depending on the type of enemy that passes through to the end of the path. The basic features for each tower will be damage points and range while the enemies will have health points and speed. Other add-ons include but are not limited to upgrades for the towers in terms of damage and range, different types of units that have special abilities, power ups, a pause button etc.

# Compile and Run Instructions:
To compile, open processing and run the program.
- #### Run Instructions:
  Similar to the real bloon tower defense, you can select the map you wish to play on and place towers anywhere on the map. The bloon will start appearing on the path once you click the start button. To pause the game, simply click start again. To place towers on map, click the tower icons in the sidebar (colored in orange) to select the tower. The selected button should turn a greyish color from black. Click anywhere on the map to place tower (with exceptions of the bloon path and special conditions). 

  Each tower has specific range so to see the range of each tower, hover mouse over the tower and a circle will appear indicating the tower's range of detection. If you didn't like your tower placement, hover mouse over the tower and hit delete button on the keyboard to remove tower from map. When tower button is selected, the upgrades menu will pop up with different upgrades for that tower type. Simply click the button to upgrade the atttributes for all towers of same type on the map. Towers can be deselected with another click, reverting the color of button back to black. 
  
  Other buttons like the skip button allowes players to skip the current level. The menu button (located on the top right, indicated by 3 white lines) brings players back to the map selection screen allowing players to change maps. Game ends through either popping all bloons or lossing all health points.
